# Gradient Methods for solving Stackelberg Games

In this repository we provide all necessary code to reproduce the experiments included in our paper "Gradient Methods for solving Stackelberg Games", presented to the 2019 Algorithmic Decision Theory conference.

## Experiment of Section 4.1

The jupyter notebook ´notebooks/easy_example.ipynb´ reproduces the experimento of Section 4.1.

## Experiment of Section 4.2

In order to reproduce the experiment of Figure 3 (a) of Section 4.2, run `python src/paper_big_experiment.py`. This script will write the results in ´results/exp1´. To analyse these results, the notebook `notebooks/analysis_adv_reg.ipynb` was used. 

In order to reproduce the experiment of Figure 3 (b) of Section 4.2, run `python src/convergence_experiment.py`. Results will be written in ´results/exp_convergence´. The notebook ´notebooks/analysis_adv_rer_convergence.ipynb´ was used to analyse such results.
